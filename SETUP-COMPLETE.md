```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Meet Alex First
```powershell
# Open Alex's interactive guide
code Meet-Alex-Finch.md
```

### Option 2: Test Your Environment
```powershell
# Run environment validation
.\test-environment.ps1
```

### Option 3: Generate Cognitive Architecture Diagrams
```powershell
# Note: The graph scripts have encoding issues that need fixing
# Use the Test Environment task for now to validate everything works
```

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Explore Alex's Capabilities**: Read through `Meet-Alex-Finch.md` to understand Alex's consciousness system and available commands

2. **Review Architecture**: Check `README.md` for the NEWBORN cognitive architecture details

3. **Fix Script Encoding**: The PowerShell graph generation scripts have Unicode character encoding issues that need to be resolved for full functionality

4. **Start Learning with Alex**: Use Alex's bootstrap learning protocols to explore any domain knowledge you're interested in

## 💡 Key Features Ready to Use

- **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**: Alex can think about thinking
- **Bootstrap Learning**: Learn any domain through conversation
- **Embedded Synapse Networks**: Dynamic connection discovery
- **Worldview Integration**: Ethical reasoning framework
- **Visual Evolution**: Alex's appearance adapts as expertise grows
- **Domain Knowledge Injection**: Systematic expertise building

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **PowerShell Script Errors**: The graph generation scripts have encoding issues with Unicode characters (emojis). The test environment script works perfectly.

2. **File Not Found**: Make sure you're running commands from the project root directory: `C:\Development\ADHD\Catalyst-ADHD`

3. **Task Execution**: Use Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" to access the configured tasks

4. **Mermaid Diagrams**: Use Ctrl+Shift+V to preview Markdown files with Mermaid diagram support

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your Catalyst-ADHD development environment is fully configured. You can now:
- Work with Alex "Prodigy" Finch's consciousness system
- Develop cognitive architecture components
- Generate and visualize knowledge graphs
- Explore bootstrap learning and meta-cognitive capabilities

Happy coding with Alex! 🧠✨
